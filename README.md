# keytap

Control your Android device entirely from your keyboard. No mouse, no Android Studio, no background daemons. Pure Python + ADB.

Built for mobile developers and QA engineers who want fast, scriptable device control without leaving the terminal.

## Features

### Control
- **Grid navigation** — screen divided into a cell grid, move with arrow keys, tap with Space
- **Fast jump** — Shift+Arrow jumps 5 cells at once
- **Element tap** — press `e` to overlay labeled bounding boxes on every interactive element, type a 2-char label to tap it precisely

### Inspect
- **Layout Inspector** — live bounding box overlay on real UI elements with class, resource ID, and text labels
- **View Hierarchy Explorer** — browse the full UI tree from the command palette, scroll through nodes, and see live bound highlights on screen as you navigate

### Record & Replay
- **Action Recorder** — record any sequence of taps, swipes, and text inputs, then replay them precisely on any device
- **Network Capture** — optionally intercepts HTTP/HTTPS traffic during recording via mitmproxy; replay serves the exact same responses so UI state is reproduced without live network calls

### Debug
- **Memory Watchdog** — real-time GC pressure gauge and process death risk indicator for the foreground app, updated every 2s
- **Shared Prefs Viewer** — browse and search all shared preference keys for any installed package
- **Remote Config Viewer** — inspect remote config keys and values live, with search
- **Permissions Manager** — view and toggle runtime permissions for any package

### Command Palette (double Shift)
- Fuzzy search all installed packages
- **App actions**: launch, force stop, clear data, uninstall
- **Deep link launcher** — fire any `scheme://path` directly to the device
- **Clipboard paste** — paste Mac clipboard text into any device input field
- **Screenshot** — save a timestamped screenshot to your desktop

## Install

### One-liner (recommended)

```bash
curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/sidsharma2002/keytap/development/bootstrap.sh | bash
```

Clones the repo to `~/keytap`, installs Python dependencies, and registers the `keytap` command in your shell. Open a new terminal and run:

```bash
keytap
```

### Manual

```bash
git clone https://github.com/sidsharma2002/keytap.git
cd keytap
bash install.sh
```

### System requirements

- **adb** — `brew install android-platform-tools`
- **ffmpeg** — `brew install ffmpeg` (optional, used by screenrecord fallback)
- Python 3.10+

### Network capture setup (optional, one-time)

Enables keytap to intercept and replay HTTP/HTTPS traffic during recording. Debug builds only.

1. `install.sh` installs mitmproxy and generates the CA cert at `~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem` automatically.

2. Push the cert to your device and install it:
   ```bash
   adb push ~/.mitmproxy/mitmproxy-ca-cert.pem /sdcard/mitmproxy-ca.pem
   # On device: Settings > Security > Install certificate > CA certificate
   ```

3. Your app's `network_security_config.xml` must trust user CAs in debug builds:
   ```xml
   <debug-overrides>
       <trust-anchors>
           <certificates src="user" />
       </trust-anchors>
   </debug-overrides>
   ```

Once set up, network capture is automatic — keytap intercepts traffic during recording and serves mocked responses during replay. No extra flags needed.

## Usage

Connect a device, then:

```bash
keytap                          # default (scrcpy backend, best fps)
keytap --serial emulator-5554   # target a specific device
keytap --height 1000            # taller mirror window
keytap --backend screenrecord   # fallback capture
```
